Please perform an analysis on the DNS data (The DNS page on Wikipedia should provide
enough information to understand the data).
The schema of the data:
1. column 1: timestamp
2. column 2: top level domain
3. column 3: second level domain
4. column 4: FQDN
5. column 5: resolved IP address
Please provide your code analyzing the data in Python script or Jupyter Notebooks. It would
help to understand your analysis if you also include explanations of your insights or conclusions.
Please use the plotting modules in Python for visualization in the Jupyter Notebooks if possible
(instead of using other tools that would require installing additional software/tools to check the
results).
