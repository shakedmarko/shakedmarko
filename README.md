- 👋 Hi, I’m @shakedmarko
- 👀 I’m interested in cool data science stuff, especially tackling real-world challenges like analyzing user behavior, exploring innovative machine learning solutions, and solving problems in cybersecurity, similarity modeling, and churn prediction.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced techniques in LLMs, causal inference, and cutting-edge methods for churn analysis and anomaly detection.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that involve predictive modeling, machine learning optimization, similarity detection, or data-driven decision-making in cybersecurity, marketing, finance, and other impactful domains.
- 📫 How to reach me: shaked.ed613@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can turn a complex data problem into a visual story faster than you can say "data-driven," and I love using data to unravel mysteries like churn prediction and anomalous behaviors.
