The goal of this assignment is to help the company increase its conversion rate via personalization of
its email marketing campaign.

Some background:
• Most users go through our unique quiz experience, in which we ask them a couple of
questions about themselves to help us with matching them the right products. In this
specific case, this is a quiz for hair and skin products.
• If a user completed the quiz but did not purchase, they receive an email after a couple of
hours to try and convert them (i.e., persuade them to purchase that product).
• For the J34 product, the marketing team decided to run an A/B test with three variants: the
original (old) email, and two variants of that email that include changes to the wording,
layout, typography, and general appearance of the email. The assignment was completely
random.

Our goal is to use the data collected during the experiment to personalize the email campaign
assignment for future users. We'd like to build a model that decides which email variant to send to a
user given the user's features available after the quiz completion, with the goal of maximizing the
conversion rate. Note that our model we’ll be used right after a user completes the quiz (before the
email is sent, and therefore we do not have purchase information on the prediction time).
Please also provide with a method to evaluate the model’s performance on a cohort of new users
(such as a test set).

You can use any known package/library/algorithm/method to solve this. It is preferred that you will
use an IPython Jupyter notebook, but any other format or language is acceptable.
Attached is the dataset with the features, email campaign assignment, an indicator of whether the
user purchased, along with some post purchase additional information.
