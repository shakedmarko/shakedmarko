Background
Supply Path Optimization (SPO) refers to the traffic management process that optimizes interactions
between supply and demand.
The Demand Partners (Buyers) set a QPS (queries per second) limit, which defines the number of requests Rise can route through the SPO
pipeline. 
This QPS constraint ensures that the SSP (Rise) does not overload the demand servers and directs only relevant traffic through the system.
Recently, our demand partners have raised concerns about a decline in performance attributed to "low-value" traffic. 
"Low-value" traffic is characterized by a low probability of receiving any response from buyers.
For example, when SPO sends a request to Buyer B, this buyer may not respond to the auction opportunity. 
While there may be various reasons for a lack of response, 
in this context, we define a "no-bid" as an indication that the buyer is uninterested.
you are tasked with evaluating these assumptions and offer an ML solution that meets the business needs.
